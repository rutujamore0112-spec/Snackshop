# SnackShop

A real-time, express campus snack ordering system built with React and Firebase. 

SnackShop is designed for high-speed, high-concurrency environments (like a busy college campus). It features live inventory tracking, atomic stock reservations, automated cart timeouts, and a sleek, dark-themed UI with Framer Motion animations.

## Features

### Customer Experience
* **Live Inventory:** Stock updates instantly across all active clients.
* **Smart Cart Reservations:** Adding an item to the cart temporarily reserves it using Firebase transactions. If checkout isn't completed within the 2-minute timer, the stock is automatically released back to the pool.
* **Express Checkout:** Pay online through Razorpay or with cash on pickup.
* **Google Authentication:** Frictionless login using Firebase Auth.
* **Responsive Design:** Highly optimized mobile-first UI with smooth touch targets and custom scrollbars.

### Admin Dashboard
* **Full Inventory Management:** Add, edit, delete, and restock products. Upload images directly to Firebase Storage or use URLs.
* **Order Processing:** Accept verified Razorpay orders or cash payments and deduct stock.
* **Payment Method Labels:** Paid order cards show "Paid by cash" or "Paid by RazorPay" beneath the timestamp on the left.
* **Cash Payments & Loans:** Choose green **Paid in full**, yellow **Paid partially**, or red **Loaned** when accepting a cash order. Enter the amount received for a partial payment.
* **Outstanding Balances:** The Loans summary replaces "Awaiting verify" and shows the total owed, with separate partial-payment and loan balances. Outstanding order cards stay highlighted. After selecting **Paid partially** or **Loaned**, the only payment action is green **Paid in full**, which collects the remaining balance from Orders or Loans.
* **Collected Revenue:** Revenue, profit, daily sales, and finance history count cash actually received. For example, receiving ₹30 on a ₹100 order adds only ₹30 to revenue and leaves ₹70 outstanding. Marking it **Paid in full** later adds only the remaining ₹70 on its collection date and does not deduct stock again. Existing paid orders remain compatible.
* **Shop Toggle:** Instantly mark the shop as "Open" or "Closed" (stops pickups but allows queuing orders).
* **Ledger & Analytics:** Track revenue, paid orders, and pending verifications dynamically grouped by month.
* **Customer Requests:** Handle custom snack requests from students.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React 18 (Vite), React Router DOM
* **Styling & UI:** Custom CSS Variables (Dark Theme), Framer Motion (Animations), Lucide React (Icons)
* **Backend / BaaS:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)
* **State Management:** React Context API (`AuthContext`, `CartContext`)
* **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rutujamore0112-spec/Snackshop.git
   cd Snackshop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values for your Firebase project. The local checkout already has its own ignored `.env.local`.

4. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Firebase client configuration is read in `src/lib/firebase.js`. Razorpay checkout also requires the server endpoints in `api/razorpay` and their server-side environment configuration.

The code was synced from [abhinavmandal68-boop/snackshop](https://github.com/abhinavmandal68-boop/snackshop). This copy uses the `snackshop-bfaf4` Firebase project alias, its existing Firestore security rules, and environment-based client configuration. Set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the server hosting environment before using payment endpoints. Review `firestore.indexes.json` against the target project's data before deploying it.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production frontend is generated in `dist/`. `npm run preview` serves the built frontend locally.

### Admin workflow

The dashboard keeps unresolved cash and verified Razorpay orders visible while
browsing history. Razorpay orders leave the action list after acceptance; cash
orders leave after recording full payment, partial payment, or a loan. The past
24 hours and unpaid loans load only when requested. Expand a monthly row to view
its full order list; monthly CSV exports use saved summaries. All order records
remain in Firebase when hidden.

Run `npm run dev` for local development. Customer sign-in is required for `/`,
and administrator access is required for `/admin/dashboard`.

Verify the production frontend with `npm run build`.

### Upstream updates

Synced through `6c68644` on `abhinavmandal68-boop/snackshop`'s
`feat/premium-shop-polish` branch (11 October 2026). The updates include mobile
checkout, product artwork fallbacks, search feedback, route loading, inventory
refresh after checkout, and admin order improvements. Rutuja's cream, blue and
yellow theme, Firebase configuration, admin identity and Firestore rules are
preserved. Local API forwarding is optional: set `DEV_API_TARGET` in `.env.local`
to your own backend URL when running `npm run dev`.
