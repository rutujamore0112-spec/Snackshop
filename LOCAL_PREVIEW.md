These routes use the configured Firebase project. Local development does not
turn order, payment, inventory, image upload, or finance actions into samples.

For API calls during `npm run dev`, set `DEV_API_TARGET` in `.env.local` to your
own deployed backend URL. Its Firebase project must match your client config.
Restart the development server after changing it.
